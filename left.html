                <h1>The Silent Village</h1>
                <img src="assets/totem.jpg">
                <p>You walk for what feels like hours, the landscape shifting around you. Soon, a small village emerges through the mist. Modest wooden huts, narrow dirt paths, and flickering torches. At first, it seems abandoned—until you step closer.</p>
                <p>Eyes. Watching you. Dozens of them. The villagers stand still, their expressions unreadable, their gazes heavy with something between suspicion and silent judgment. It’s as if you’ve done something wrong—though you have no idea what.</p>
                <p>As you pass through the entrance, two massive men step forward, blocking your path. Their presence is intimidating, but they don’t speak. They simply stare.</p>
                <p>Swallowing your unease, you clear your throat. "I’m looking for my tribe. Do you know where they are?"</p>
                <p>Silence. Unmoving.</p>
                <p>Then, after what feels like an eternity, one of them slowly turns and points toward the center of the village.</p>
                <p>You follow their gaze and see towering wooden totems standing proudly in the heart of the settlement. Each one is carved with intricate patterns, faces of spirits and beasts etched into the wood. Totems are sacred—marking history, honoring ancestors, protecting the people. Every tribe has their own, telling their unique story.</p>
                <p>As you study them, one in particular catches your eye. It’s different from the rest. The carvings don’t match the others. Something about it feels important, like a piece of a puzzle—maybe even a hint for the riddle you failed earlier.</p>
                <p>What do you do?</p>
