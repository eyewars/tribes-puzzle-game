                <h1>A mysterious encounter</h1>
                <p>Your eyes flutter open to an unfamiliar sky, a dull gray stretching endlessly above. The air is cold, carrying the scent of damp earth and distant smoke. You push yourself up, your head pounding, your limbs stiff. Around you, the land is barren—no signs of your people, no familiar landmarks, just an empty stretch of wilderness.</p>
                <p>Panic tightens in your chest. Where am I? The last thing you remember is being with your tribe, the warmth of the fire, the murmur of voices. But now… nothing. Only silence.</p>
                <p>You scan the horizon, searching for anything that might lead you home. A narrow path winds through the landscape, barely visible among the wild grasses and scattered stones. You have no choice but to follow it, hoping it will take you where you need to go.</p>
