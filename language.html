                <p>Realization hits you. "It’s their language," you say.</p>
                <p>The tribespeople smile, nodding in approval. "Yes. Our neighbors speak in clicks, just as we mark our stories on skin."</p>
                <p>They motion for you to come closer and unroll a rough map on the ground. With careful gestures, they show you the right path—your tribe is closer than you thought.</p>
                <p>Grateful, you thank them for their kindness and prepare to leave. "Safe travels," they say as you part ways.</p>
                <p>At last, after all this time, you are heading home.</p>
