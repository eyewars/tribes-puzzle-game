                <h1>A mysterious encounter</h1>
                <p>As you walk, the loneliness of the road weighs on youâ€”until you spot someone ahead. A man, moving at a steady pace. His clothes are worn, his boots caked in dust, and on his back, he carries a large pack filled with things unknown. His face is weathered, but his eyes are sharp, studying you as you approach.</p>
                <p>"You look lost," he says, his voice calm but unreadable.</p>
                <p>"I am," you admit. "I'm looking for my tribe. Do you know which way they went?"</p>
                <p>He tilts his head, considering. "I might," he says. "But knowledge comes at a price. Answer me this: I have no home, yet I carry all I own on my back. What am I?"</p>
                <p>A test. A riddle. If you answer correctly, he might help you find your way.</p>
                <p>What is your answer?</p>
