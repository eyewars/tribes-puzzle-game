                <p>You frown, unsure of the right response. "I don’t know… what is this journey called?"</p>
                <p>One of the tribe members chuckles and gestures toward a nearby hut. On its wooden walls, strange numbers are carved in a row:</p>
                <p>130907180120091514</p>

                <p>A faded drawing of people moving together is etched beside it. The meaning is just within reach—you just need to figure it out.</p>
                <p>What is the name of this movement?</p>
