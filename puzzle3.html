                <h1>Unknown Tribe</h1>
                <p>The woman smiles at your understanding. "Yes. Our marks tell our stories, our past, our journeys. Would you like to take part in the ritual?"</p>
                <p>Something about this place feels right. The music, the fire, the people. You nod, letting yourself be drawn into the celebration. They paint symbols on your skin, and for the first time since waking up in the unknown, you feel a sense of belonging.</p>
                <p>The night is a blur of dancing, music, and laughter. Eventually, exhaustion takes over, and you fall asleep beneath the stars.</p>
                <p>When morning comes, the tribe is preparing to move.</p>
                <p>"We are traveling to a new home," one of them tells you as they hand you food. "In the direction of your own tribe. You should come with us."</p>
                <p>Of course, you agree. After all, you enjoy the adventure—and the company.</p>
                <p>As you walk with them, someone speaks of the movement of people from one place to another. "This journey… it has a name."</p>
                <p>What is it called?</p>
