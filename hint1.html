                <h1>A Revelation</h1>
                <p>You step closer to the totems, tracing the carvings with your fingers. Each one tells a story—legends of ancestors, battles fought, spirits honored. But one stands out. The patterns are unfamiliar, and yet, something about them feels connected to the riddle.</p>
                <p>And then it clicks. No home. Carries everything on his back. The answer was in front of you all along.</p>
                <p>You turn away, ready to retrace your steps, to find the man again. But as you near the village exit, he is already there—waiting. A knowing smirk rests on his face.</p>
                <p>He speaks, his voice steady, expectant.</p>
                <p>"I have no home, yet I carry all I own on my back. What am I?"</p>
                <p>This time, you know.</p>
