                <h1>A mysterious encounter</h1>
                <p>The man’s expression shifts—disappointment flickers across his face. You must have answered incorrectly.</p>
                <p>He exhales slowly, adjusting the straps of his heavy pack. "Not the answer I was looking for," he says. "Seems you'll have to find your own way, then." Without another word, he steps past you, continuing on his endless journey, leaving you alone once more.</p>
                <p>A fork in the path lies ahead. Two choices. No clues. Just instinct.</p>
