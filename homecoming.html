                <h1>A Guide Through the Unknown</h1>
                <p>As you step into your village, familiar faces rush toward you. Gasps of relief, joyful laughter, warm embraces.</p>
                <p>"Omg, we missed you so much!" someone exclaims. "Where were you?"</p>
                <p>You smile, feeling the weight of your journey settle. "I woke up in the middle of nowhere," you explain, "but on my way back, I learned so much about other tribes—their ways, their stories, their people."</p>
                <p>To celebrate your return, a great feast is prepared. The village fills with music and laughter, firelight flickering as the night deepens.</p>
                <p>Then, through the crowd, a familiar figure approaches.</p>
                <p>The traveler.</p>
                <p>A grin on his face, he holds out a wooden cup filled with a strange brownish liquid. "Quite the journey, huh?" he says. "Here, drink. You’ve earned it."</p>
                <p>You hesitate. Should you trust him?</p>
