                <p>Understanding dawns on you. "Migration," you say aloud.</p>
                <p>The tribespeople nod approvingly. "Yes. We move as one, seeking a new home."</p>
                <p>With that, you continue the journey together, heading toward the direction of your own tribe. The days pass in a blur of travel, shared meals, and stories told under the night sky.</p>
                <p>Finally, as you near your destination, something unusual happens. The ones traveling with you pause, their heads tilting. From the distance, faint rhythmic clicking sounds echo through the air. This sounds came from another tribe living in this area.</p>
                <p>They glance at you, curious. "What is that sound? What could it mean?"</p>
