                <h1>A Guide Through the Unknown</h1>
                <p>You follow the path toward the unknown tribe, but as you glance back, you notice something odd—your so-called friend isn’t coming with you. He simply stands there, watching, an unreadable expression on his face.</p>
                <p>"You go on ahead," he says with a smirk. "This part isn’t for me."</p>
                <p>Before you can question him, he turns and disappears down another road.</p>
                <p>You push forward, and soon, the distant sound of rhythmic drumming reaches your ears. As you step into the clearing, the sight before you is mesmerizing—people dancing in a wild, hypnotic rhythm, painted figures moving around a towering fire. Their bodies are covered in intricate markings, swirls of ink etched into their skin, each telling a story you cannot yet understand.</p>
                <p>The tribe notices you immediately, but instead of hostility, they greet you warmly. A woman with spiraling symbols across her arms steps forward. "You came at a special time," she says. "We are in the middle of our ritual. Would you like to join us?"</p>
                <p>They gesture toward the gathering, where some are preparing dyes and tools. They have something on there skin. hat are we seeing. </p>
                <p>What are we seeing?</p>
